1700 CE

http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-89919.html

The Romain du Roi (French for "King's roman") was a typeface developed in France beginning in 1692. The name refers to Louis XIV who commissioned the design of the new typeface for use by the Royal Print Office.

Developed by Louis Simonneau and Phillipe Grandjean

- constructed alphabet
- created on a grid of 64 units and then further into 36 units - a total of 2304 squares
- increased contrast of thick and thin elements
- first "transitional" type

Fournier le Jeune, Pierre-Simon Fournier (1712-1768)

Rococo era - pre revolution - height of ornament/"excess"

Pierre-Simon Fournier (15 September 1712 – 8 October 1768) was a French mid-18th century punch-cutter, typefounder and typographic theoretician. He was both a collector and originator of types. Fournier's contributions to printing were his creation of initials and ornaments, his design of letters, and his standardization of type sizes. He worked in the rococo form, and designed typefaces including Fournier and Narcissus. He was known for incorporating ‘decorative typographic ornaments’ into his typefaces. Fournier's main accomplishment is that he ‘created a standardized measuring system that would revolutionize the typography industry forever’.

Type Scale

In 1723, the French government agreed that types should be subject to standards. By 1737, the younger Fournier decided to begin creating his punches to a scale of 6 ciceros or 72 points to the Paris inch, instead of the then-standard height-to-paper method. This point is smaller than the subsequent Didot point established by François-Ambroise Didot 38 years later, as Fournier used the Paris foot (0.298 m) and Didot used the royal foot (pied du roi, 0.325 m). The Fournier cicero (12 points) is approximately 11 Didot points

**Advancements in Engraving**

- increased contrast between thick and thin was inspiring to typographers

George Bickham the Elder (1684–1758) was an English writing master and engraver.

**England - Baskerville and Caslon**

Up to the 1700's England never really conducive to type innovation until...

**William Caslon (1692-1766)**

 English typefounder. The distinction and legibility of his type secured him the patronage of the leading printers of the day in England and on the continent. His typefaces transformed English type design and first established an English national typographic style.

 **Baskerville** 
 
 John Baskerville
 1706 - 1765
 
 - innovator
 - businessman
 - attention to detail
 - Transitional style, inspired by Continental trends

John Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge in 1758 and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio Bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer.  Baskerville's work was criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour, but since the 1920s many new fonts have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries – revivals of his work and mostly called 'Baskerville'. Emigre released a popular revival of this typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for Baskerville's wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville's most notable typeface Baskerville represents the peak of transitional type face and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern type design.

**Italy - Bodoni**

Giambattista Bodoni 1740-1813

Italian typographer, type-designer, compositor, printer and publisher in Parma.

Bodoni achieved an unprecedented level of technical refinement, allowing him to faithfully reproduce letterforms with very thin "hairlines", standing in sharp contrast to the thicker lines constituting the main stems of the characters. He became known for his designs of pseudoclassical typefaces and highly styled editions some considered more apt "to be admired for typeface and layout, not to be studied or read." His printing reflected an aesthetic of plain, unadorned style, combined with purity of materials. This style attracted many admirers and imitators, surpassing the popularity of French typographers such as Philippe Grandjean and Pierre Simon Fournier.

Developed the Quitenssential Modern typeface with Bodoni 

slightly condensed underlying structure with flat, unbracketed serifs, extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, and an overall geometric construction.

1818 - Manuale Tipografica

"well-designed type derived its beauty from four principles: uniformity of design, sharpness and neatness, good taste, and charm". His typefaces display an unprecedented degree of technical refinement, and epitomize purity and grace. The culmination of more than four decades of work, the Manuale tipografico represents one of history’s greatest typographical achievements.

**Didot - The other Modern Typeface**

Didot was a family type dynasty in France

http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-39691.html

Didot is a group of typefaces named after the famous French printing and type producing Didot family. The classification is known as modern, or Didone.

The most famous Didot typefaces were developed in the period 1784–1811. Firmin Didot (1764–1836) cut the letters, and cast them as type in Paris. His brother, Pierre Didot (1760–1853) used the types in printing. His edition of La Henriade by Voltaire in 1818 is considered his masterwork. The typeface takes inspiration from John Baskerville's experimentation with increasing stroke contrast and a more condensed armature. The Didot family's development of a high contrast typeface with an increased stress is contemporary to similar faces developed by Giambattista Bodoni in Italy.

![[82282e3349873023dbf79f776cccd4e0.jpg]]

Didot is described as neoclassical, and evocative of the Age of Enlightenment.
